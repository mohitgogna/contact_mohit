## Architecture

This is a starter kit for Nx with Lowgular and Simple Architecture

It is app-only approach, meaning we create everything in `application` project type

The architecture consists of 3 main parts:

### Model

A Readonly Interface representing data fetched from backend and needed in the `Component`

### Service

Angular Injectable responsible for fetching data from backend.
You can inject `HttpClient` in it
It returns `Model`

### Component

Angular Component responsible for presenting data on a specific route.
You can inject `Service` in it
It uses `Model` to present the data

## Templates

The starter kit uses `angular components` (angular material) package.

You have templates already setup for you.

There are 2 types of templates

### Layouts

Static HTML that can be injected without any data with it

### Templates

HTML that is connected to specific data. We distinguish between properties in your components.

In order to add a template, use `Actions...` menu by right click inside any `.html` file

#### Forms

If a property is a form, it will output form fields

#### Lists

If a property is an array, it will output lists with children

#### Objects

If a property is an object, it will output properties of an object
